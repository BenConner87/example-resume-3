            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I remember my first attempt at DEBUGGING a function on StackOVerflow like it was yesterday. I knew that I had to FLEX my brain and think outside the BOX. I needed a good stragtegy before I REACT. I did not find successfully find the BUG that day, but the coding BUG found me. The next day I had to pull myself up by my BOOTSTRAPs and PROMISEd myself I would do better. "You need to GIT your act together", I told myself. I was a little bit SASSy , but I left a voicemail hoping they would CALLBACK. I realized there was an ARRAY of errors in my approad. I was too OBJECTive in my efforts and didn't reduce the problem enough.</p>
